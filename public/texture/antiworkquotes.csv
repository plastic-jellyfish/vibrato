If hard work were such a wonderful thing surely the rich would have kept it all to themselves.-- Lane Kirkland
In the year 1930 John Maynard Keynes predicted that by century’s end technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would have achieved a fifteen-hour work week. There’s every reason to believe he was right. In technological terms we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn’t happen. Instead technology has been marshaled if anything to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this jobs have had to be created that are effectively pointless. Huge swathes of people in Europe and North America in particular spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it. -- David Graeber On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs
Work in the social world in which you and I find ourselves is the alienation of an individual’s time activities and forces from her/himself. In other words it is the institutionalization of a process where the things you do the things I do and the things we do together are determined by powers (individuals social structures etc) outside of ourselves to serve their interests. In compensation we receive what we need to survive and perhaps some extra to keep us pacified.-- Apio Ludd A Sales Pitch for the Insurrection
Work has not only become the center of every concern but confident in its independence it also imposes its measure on free time amusement encounters and reflection. In short it is presented as the measure of life itself.-- Massimo Passamani Letter on Specialization
What if there was a general strike -- and it proved permanent because it made no demands it was already the satisfaction of all demands?-- Bob Black No Future for the Workplace
We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.-- Buckminster Fuller
In our society work is defined as the act by which an employee contracts out her or his labour power as property in the person to an employer for fair monetary compensation. This way of describing work of understanding it as a fair exchange between two equals hides the real relationship between employer and employee: that of domination and subordination. For if the truth behind the employment contract were widely known workers in our society would refuse to work because they would see that it is impossible for human individuals to truly separate out labour power from themselves.
“Property in the person” doesn’t really exist as something that an individual can simply sell as a separate thing. Machinists cannot just detach from themselves the specific skills needed by an employer; those skills are part of an organic whole that cannot be disengaged from the entire person similarly sex appeal is an intrinsic part of exotic dancers and it is incomprehensible how such a constitutive intangible characteristic could be severed from the dancers themselves. A dancer has to be totally present in order to dance just like a machinist must be totally present in order to work; neither can just send their discrete skills to do the work for them.
Whether machinist dancer teacher secretary or pharmacist it is not only one’s skills that are being sold to an employer it is also one’s very being. When employees contract out their labour power as property in the person to employers what is really happening is that employees are selling their own self determination their own wills their own freedom. In short they are during their hours of employment slaves.-- L. Susan Brown Does Work Really Work?
If a large number of men accept the legitimacy of these conventions if they accept the convention that commodities are a prerequisite for money and that money is a prerequisite for survival then they find themselves locked into a vicious circle. Since they have no commodities their only exit from this circle is to regard themselves or parts of themselves as commodities. And this is in fact the peculiar “solution” which men impose on themselves in the face of specific material and historical conditions. They do not exchange their bodies or parts of their bodies for money. They exchange the creative content of their lives their practical daily activity for money.-- Fredy Perlman The Reproduction of Daily Life
People don’t need any convincing to hate their jobs--their jobs do that for them. Like hating the police hating your job is one of the most beautiful and natural things you can do which is why popular culture works so hard to convince us that cops are heroes and that jobs are actually good.-- Kassandra Vee Work Sucks 
Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren’t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups public or private. Either way dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.
And so it is although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace.-- Bob Black The Abolition of Work
The exploited are forced to sell the time of their life to their exploiters in exchange for survival. And this is the real tragedy of work. The social order of work is based on the imposed opposition between life and survival. The question of how one will get by suppresses that of how one wants to live and in time this all seems natural and one narrows one’s dreams and desires to the things that money can buy.-- Wolfi Landstreicher Work: The Theft of Life
Behind the glorification of 'work' and the tireless talk of the 'blessings of work' I find the same thought as behind the praise of impersonal activity for the public benefit: the fear of everything individual. At bottom one now feels when confronted with work – and what is invariably meant is relentless industry from early till late – that such work is the best police that it keeps everybody in harness and powerfully obstructs the development of reason of covetousness of the desire for independence. For it uses up a tremendous amount of nervous energy and takes it away from reflection brooding dreaming worry love and hatred; it always sets a small goal before one's eyes and permits easy and regular satisfactions. In that way a society in which the members continually work hard will have more security: and security is now adored as the supreme goddess...-- Friedrich Nietzsche The Dawn of Day p. 173
No man earns punishment no man earns reward. Free your mind of the idea of deserving the idea of earning and you will begin to be able to think.-- Ursula K. Le Guin The Dispossessed
Today capitalism requires a different kind of person to those it required in the past. Up until recently there was a need for people with professional capacities a pride in this capacity and particular qualifications. The situation is quite different now. The world of work requires a very modest qualification level whereas qualities that did not exist and were even inconceivable in the past such as flexibility adaptability tolerance the capacity to intervene at meetings etc. are required in their place.
Huge production units based on assembly lines for example now use robots or are built on the conceptual basis of islands small groups working together who know each other and control each other and so on. This kind of mentality is not only found in the factory. It is not just a ‘new worker’ they are building but a ‘new man’; a flexible person with modest ideas rather opaque in their desires with considerably reduced cultural levels impoverished language standardised reading a limited capacity to think and a great capacity to make quick yes or no decisions. They know how to choose between two possibilities: a yellow button a red button a black button a white button. This is the kind of mentality they are building. And where are they building it? At school but also in everyday life.
What will they do with such a person? They will use them to bring about all the modifications that are necessary for restructuring capital. They will be useful for a better management of the conditions and relations of the capitalism of tomorrow.-- Alfredo M. Bonanno The Anarchist Tension
Automation which is both the most advanced sector of modern industry and the epitome of its practice obliges the commodity system to resolve the following contradiction: The technological developments that objectively tend to eliminate work must at the same time preserve labor as a commodity because labor is the only creator of commodities. The only way to prevent automation (or any other less extreme method of increasing labor productivity) from reducing society’s total necessary labor time is to create new jobs. To this end the reserve army of the unemployed is enlisted into the tertiary or “service” sector reinforcing the troops responsible for distributing and glorifying the latest commodities; and in this it is serving a real need in the sense that increasingly extensive campaigns are necessary to convince people to buy increasingly unnecessary commodities.-- Guy Debord The Society of the Spectacle
There is no such thing as freed labour. There is no such thing as integrated labour (manual-intellectual). What does exist is the division of labour and the sale of the workforce i.e. the capitalist world of production. The revolution is the negation of labour and the affirmation of joy. Any attempt to impose the idea of work ‘fair work’ work without exploitation ‘self-managed’ work where the exploited are to re-appropriate themselves of the whole of the productive process without exploitation is a mystification.
The concept of the selfmanagement of production is valid only as a form of struggle against capitalism in fact it cannot be separated from the idea of the selfmanagement of the struggle. If the struggle is extinguished selfmanagement becomes nothing other than selfmanagement of one’s exploitation. If the struggle is victorious the selfmanagement of production becomes superfluous because after the revolution the organisation of production is superfluous and counter-revolutionary.-- Alfredo M. Bonanno Armed Joy
Man like all living beings adapts and accustoms himself to the conditions under which he lives and passes on acquired habits. Thus having being born and bred in bondage when the descendants of a long line of slaves started to think they believed that slavery was an essential condition of life and freedom seemed impossible to them. Similarly workers who for centuries were obliged and therefore accustomed to depend for work that is bread on the goodwill of the master and to see their lives always at the mercy of the owners of the land and of capital ended by believing that it is the master who feeds them and ingenuously ask one how would it be possible to live if there were no masters.-- Errico Malatesta Anarchy
The modern state the rule of the bourgeoisie is based on freedom of labour .... Freedom of Labour is free competition of the workers among themselves.... Labor is free in all civilized countries; it is not a matter of freeing labor but of abolishing it.-- Karl Marx and F. Engels The German Ideology
They deem me mad because I will not sell my days for gold; and I deem them mad because they think my days have a price.-- Khalil Gibran Sand and Foam
A time-and-motion engineer watching a bear near a berry patch would not know when to punch his clock. Does the bear start working when he walks to the berry patch when he picks the berry when he opens his jaws? If the engineer has half a brain he might say the bear makes no distinction between work and play. If the engineer has an imagination he might say that the bear experiences joy from the moment the berries turn deep red and that none of the bear’s motions are work.-- Fredy Perlman Against His-story Against Leviathan
Work. The word has a stink of executions and of slow agony. It’s the coat of mud and pus that soils the hidden side of the gold coins: the decimated slaves the flayed serfs the proletarians sliced in two by fatigue fear and the oppression of the passing days life broken into pieces by the wage. The truest monuments to its efficient glory are the glassed in balconies looking out over gates saying “arbeit macht frei” a message that expresses the quintessence of commodity civilization: work will free you... from life.-- Raoul Vaneigem Address to the Living
The bourgeois morality was and is primarily a morality of work and of metier. Work purifies ennobles; it is a virtue and a remedy. Work is the only thing that makes life worthwhile; it replaces God and the life of the spirit. More precisely it identifies God with work: success becomes a blessing. God expresses his satisfaction by distributing money to those who have worked well. Before this first of all virtues the others fade into obscurity. If laziness was the mother of all the vices work was the father of all the virtues. This attitude was carried so far that bourgeois civilization neglected every virtue but work.-- Jacques Ellul The Technological Society
The bottom line is simple: all of us deserve to make the most of our potential as we see fit to be the masters of our own destinies. Being forced to sell these things away to survive is tragic and humiliating.
We don’t have to live like this.-- CrimethInc. The Mythology of Work
